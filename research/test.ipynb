       " Document(page_content='CCSAP 2017  Book 2   •  Renal/Pulmonary Critical Care 8 Acute Kidney Injurybased on changes in two markers: SCr and urinary output. \\nThe classification includes three graded stages of AKI – risk, \\ninjury, and failure – with two outcomes: loss of kidney func -\\ntion greater than 4 weeks and end-stage renal disease greater \\nthan 3 months (Lopes 2013). The RIFLE-defined period for \\nchange in SCr or urinary output was 7 days.\\nAfter implementing the RIFLE classification, clinicians and \\ninvestigators noted two problematic issues. First, AKI outcomes \\nwere worse in patients who developed AKI by SCr than by uri -\\nnary output criteria. Second, the defined change in SCr value did \\nnot equate to the defined change in GFR (i.e., a 50% increase in SCr corresponds with a 33% decrease in GFR). Subsequently, \\nGFR was not included in the Acute Kidney Injury Network \\n(AKIN) or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) \\ndefinitions.\\nAKIN Criteria\\nIn 2007, AKIN updated and modified the RIFLE criteria to \\ndefine AKI and the staging system. The definition of AKI is \\nan abrupt increase in SCr of 0.3 mg/dL over baseline within \\n48 hours, a 50% or greater increase in SCr within 7 days, or \\nurinary output of less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour for more than 6 \\nhours. Studies had shown significantly increased mortal -\\nity with small elevations in SCr (0.3–0.5 mg/dL) over a short \\nperiod (24–48 hours). The AKIN staging system corresponds \\nwith the RIFLE categories. The loss and end-stage renal dis -\\nease categories are removed from staging and considered \\noutcomes (Table 1-1).\\nKDIGO Guidelines\\nIn 2012, the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines defined AKI \\nas an SCr increase of 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a 50% \\nincrease in SCr within the previous 7 days (KDIGO 2012). The \\nstaging system was maintained the same as AKIN; however, \\na GFR of less than 35 mL/minute/1.73 m2 was added for pedi -\\natric patients as a criterion for stage 3 AKI.\\nBiomarkers\\nSerum creatinine is a well-recognized marker of kidney func -\\ntion and not a sensitive kidney injury marker, given that it may \\nlag 48–72 hours from the time of injury. Kidney injury bio -\\nmarkers are needed to improve AKI detection and will likely \\nreplace SCr in the definition and staging of AKI. Kidney dam -\\nage biomarkers, including kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), \\nneutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin \\n(IL)-18, liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), insu -\\nlin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7), and tissue BASELINE KNOWLEDGE STATEMENTS \\nReaders of this chapter are presumed to be familiar \\nwith the following:\\n• General knowledge of the pathophysiology that \\nleads to acute kidney injury\\n• Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative criteria\\n• CKD stages\\n• Estimate and measure CrCl and GFR\\n• General knowledge of renal replacement therapy\\nTable of common laboratory reference values.\\nADDITIONAL READINGS \\nThe following free resources have additional back -\\nground information on this topic:\\n• Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes \\n(KDIGO).
